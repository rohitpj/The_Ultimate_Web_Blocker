# Website-Blocker

This was developed purely for myself for fun/completely stop my from procastinating and I would not recommend use.

Tired of losing focus every 30s? I've got you, this is a normal website blocker but you have to solve a leetcode problem to unblock websites. You can also put some files up as collateral, they are encrypted and only decrypted when the blocking time has elapsed. If you must you can uncomment lines 54 & 55 in file_encryption.py to temporarily delete the original files so if you feel tempted to close the program you need to decrypt them yourself :).

Quick disclaimer, please, PLEASE do not use file_encryption if you haven't reviewed the code yourself and tested with sm random file, it seems good here but I have no idea how it will go on other platforms or devices and I will feel bad if your files are lost.

Will need to run as admin, edit websites you want to block in source code since it won't be happening much.
